# Butterfly-Threat-Detection

🦋Butterfly is an AI-driven threat detection and reporting platform designed to identify early indicators of security risks. Drawing inspiration from the “butterfly effect,” the system analyzes incoming threat reports, network activity, and communication patterns to detect subtle anomalies before they develop into serious incidents.
